# Profilo Games for fun (W.I.P)
Profilo is a tiny compact project I have made to fit free mini-games into a browser with ease and can be accessed with low-ram devices. My main approach to this used to be a tiny little test to test my web-development skills but now I am fully commiting to this. If you wanna learn more info about this then I'll make events in Github. I will try to implement a 3d engine with 3d games in Javascript to Profilo. And also if those who are wondering I wont be putting any weird or copied games into the site even if the game is allowed for copied use.
# Perks of using Profilo
* Built in 3d engine
* No annoying ads inturupting gameplay
* Ads only appear on the side
* Quality games that aren't copied or weird
* Simple web design easy to use
# Running Profilo games from the File or from the Github Pages
Profilo will be open source so you can modify it but you cannot upload it onto Github Pages. If you wanna modify the old version of Profilo or the new I will probably make two folders for those versions in the future, Right now it is still in development.'
Everything will be organized in the File Explorer do not worry. Javascript and CSS will be into one html file for example: 

**<!doctype html>**
**<html>**
**<head>**
**css code here**
**</head>**
**<body**
**html code here**
**<script>**
**js code here**
**</script>**
**</body>**
**<html>**
